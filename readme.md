# Medicine Vending Machine by Fingerprint

## Preferene

* Arduino MEGA 2560
* Push-Pull solenoid
* TIP120 Transistor
* 4CH RELAY 
* I2C LCD 16x2 4PIN

## Instructions

#### Caution
you should import my libraries in your Arduino library folder

#### Software
First, if you look inside the base folder, there is a basic code for using a four-channel relay and lcd. I think it'd be good to refer to it when you're confused about the main code

Then, if you look inside the main folder, you will see 'fingerprint enroll' and 'lock codes' First, the 'enroll code' is executed to register the fingerprint, and then the'lock code' is executed
